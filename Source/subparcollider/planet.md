1. Generate the fucking data



2. Render it



3. Cerebrate




map a sphere onto a cube
subdivide the cube (I have done that already)
apply a heightmap to each face of the cube
the heightmap should be mipmapped
the mipmap should be procedurally generated from a geological model plus impact craters plus player modifications.

the planet object has to be stored in a database
in memory it should be a graph
should probably keep the entire planet in memory, just not generate mipmaps at higher resolution than rendered.

geological model: plate tectonics or not, volcanism or not, weather/erosion, liquids or not
caves?  lava tubes?  underground rivers?  underground lakes?  underground oceans?
other interesting geological features.. endless possibilities but so little time

very young stars have protoplanetary disks and lava planets
lava planets are inhospitable but they have various devils and demons, fire elementals and dragons
red dragons are red because of black-body radiation in the red color spectrum
gold dragons are significantly hotter
their scales are made of tungsten or nanocarbon or something like that, something strong and heat resistant

gas planets can have floating cities and airships

initially the detail level can be low res, kinda 4x civilization map of each planet and some moons and asteroids
interesting minerals will often be concentrated in craters, but we can randomly distribute some minerals based on what
type of rock is in a location.

gas and dust -> molten core, method of formation determines temperature and composition
cools, stuff happens
age, size and temperature leads to initial conditions for life or a dead planet


game modes:

* fight over a planet or moon
   realtime or turn-based

* be an adventurer in a game with powerful npc factions

* start on a random planet, moon or asteroid


turn-based 4x combat:
melee unit moves into the same square as an enemy to attack them
advantage goes to the defender if the defender is fortified, otherwise it goes to the attacker
advantage gets to attack first, then disadvantage, then any advantage units who didn't lose at least half their remaining hit points in the counterattack. subsequent turns each party can either run away or brawl. in a brawl both attackers and defenders get 1 attack each, simultaneously, regardless of advantage.

ranged units bombarding from another tile only get 1 attack each turn, but the defenders don't get a counterattack
ranged units attacking in melee with advantage get 1 ranged attack and 1 melee attack, then the defender gets a counterattack


transport tycoon city building dynamics - cities with good access to stuff and good infrastructure grow quickly
food
water
consumer goods
valuables
research
high tech components
heavy machinery
minerals
gas
energy
education
culture

bigger factories produce stuff faster, thus gaining xp faster and can reach higher levels of productivity (cost reduction)
smaller factories are cheaper and faster to retool


npc faction:

attitude towards us:

genocide [0 ... 100]
skepticism [0 ... 100]
fear [0 ... 100]
respect [0 ... 100]
trade [0 ... 100]
friendship [0 ... 100]
loyalty [0 ... 100]
benevolence [0 ... 100]



ai should be able to do everything the player can do, and the player should be able to assign ai to automate any task
this way the player can focus on whichever part of gameplay they prefer
some game modes should be designed with npc factions the player doesn't control so that the player can feel small in a big
living world


game modes can include persistent world mmo, multiplayer skirmish, singleplayer/coop storyline/campaign, sandbox, custom scenario
