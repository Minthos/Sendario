Make a basic space exploration prototype

A solar system with the sun, some planets, and a circular "spaceship" with a gaslight drive

I have to implement:
spherical + cartesian coordinates - done!
gravity between celestials
w-space
a spaceship
solve physics locally
render celestials with scaling hack to keep them inside the view frustum
