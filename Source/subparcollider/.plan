Test the ctree

Render some terrain

Implement gravity and basic collision testing

define surface level as 0 in lieu of terrain procgen
render a flattened box for every occupied node in the ctree at ground level

render a transparent box for every occupied node in the ctree





physics engine: record and replay
every second: snapshot of the physics state
every tick: only the variables that changed






representing the player's UI state
rts, controlling a vehicle, controlling a character


representing players, npcs
"owner" class, can own many units and vehicles
"unit" class: player characters, NPCs, vehicles


representing the world, its resources and objects not owned by anyone in particular



representing the market, contracts, communications, politics, factions, fleets/squads

need a simple way to flag owners as friends or foes of each other for basic combat functionality

I want to implement some guns (fixed angle, turret, point defense) and a homing missile to have at least
some basic combat functionality.



shadows

we can cast a few shadow rays from the z buffer at a low resolution as a first pass
if 4 points in a square have the same value (shaded or lit) fill in the area between them with the same value
optionally cast an extra ray for points with wildly different z-value than its neighbors
for the remaining points, cast additional rays to find the edge
if the ray to the obscuring object is long relative to the size and position of the light source,
stop at a low resolution and blur the edge. if it's short, trace the edge at a high resolution
finally fill in the areas on both sides of the edge
