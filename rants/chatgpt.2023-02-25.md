> I want to code a computer game. I'm using Ubuntu Linux. It should be a 3d game where players can build spaceships, fly them and land on moons and planets.

gpt:
That sounds like a fun project! Here are some steps you can follow to get started:

Choose a game engine: There are several game engines you can choose from, such as Unity, Unreal Engine, Godot, and more. Research which one will work best for your project and fits your skillset.

Learn a programming language: Most game engines use a specific programming language. For example, Unity uses C# and Unreal Engine uses C++. Choose a language you feel comfortable with and start learning it.

Familiarize yourself with 3D modeling software: You'll need to create 3D models of your spaceships and planets. Blender is a popular open-source 3D modeling software that works well with Linux.

Start building your game: Start with a simple prototype to get a feel for how the game will work. Once you have a basic version, you can start adding more features.

Test and iterate: Test your game often to identify bugs and areas that need improvement. Use player feedback to make changes and improve the game.

Publish your game: Once your game is ready, you can publish it on various platforms such as Steam, Itch.io, or your own website.

Remember, building a game takes time and patience. Don't be afraid to ask for help or seek out tutorials if you get stuck. Good luck with your project!

> I want to generate all the assets in the game without using any imported assets. Planets, moons and asteroids should be generated procedurally and spaceships should be built by the players by assembling geometric shapes that can be mathematically computed.

gpt:
Generating all the assets in your game procedurally can be a complex but exciting challenge. Here are some steps you can take to generate the assets you need for your game:

Learn about procedural generation: Familiarize yourself with the concept of procedural generation and its different techniques, such as noise functions, fractals, and cellular automata. This will help you determine the best approach for generating the assets in your game.

Create algorithms to generate planets, moons, and asteroids: Use your knowledge of procedural generation to create algorithms that generate the different celestial bodies in your game. This can involve generating terrain, adding textures and details, and placing objects.

Design geometric shapes for the spaceships: Determine the geometric shapes you want to use for the different parts of the spaceships, such as the body, wings, engines, and weapons. You can create these shapes using mathematical formulas, such as equations for cylinders, spheres, and cones.

Create a system for assembling the spaceships: Develop a system that allows players to assemble the different geometric shapes to create their own spaceships. This can involve snapping the shapes together, adjusting their size and position, and adding textures and details.

Test and iterate: Test your procedural generation algorithms and spaceship assembly system to identify areas that need improvement. Use player feedback to make changes and improve the game.

Publish your game: Once your game is ready, you can publish it on various platforms such as Steam, Itch.io, or your own website.

Keep in mind that procedural generation can be resource-intensive, so you may need to optimize your algorithms and systems to ensure your game runs smoothly. Good luck with your project!

> Haha, I just unzipped the Unreal Engine file using two processes at once. I wanted to see if unzip or 7z would extract multithreaded because it was pretty slow, it's a 22 GB zip file and I have a fast SSD. So I ended up running two processes at once, trying to unzip the same files. I told both of them to skip files that already exist and I think they managed to mostly avoid interfering with each other. They gave me a few errors about not being able to open the output file but the write bandwidth usage of my disk went up to 400 MB/s so I think it worked.

> Anyway, how do I start it up? I have never used UE before.

gpt:
Great, you managed to extract the Unreal Engine file successfully! Here are the steps to start Unreal Engine:

Open the Unreal Engine Editor: Double-click the executable file you extracted to launch the Unreal Engine Editor. You may be prompted to create a new project or open an existing one.

Create a new project: If you're starting a new project, select "New Project" and choose the project type and settings you want.

Explore the editor interface: Once your project is open, take some time to explore the Unreal Engine Editor interface. Familiarize yourself with the different tabs, menus, and tools available.

Start building your game: Use the editor tools to build your game world, create game mechanics, and add assets such as characters, objects, and environments.

Test and iterate: Test your game often to identify bugs and areas that need improvement. Use player feedback to make changes and improve the game.

Publish your game: Once your game is ready, you can publish it on various platforms such as Steam, Itch.io, or your own website.

There are many resources available to help you learn how to use Unreal Engine, including documentation, tutorials, and community forums. Good luck with your project!




me:
> There's no executable. There are 4 folders: Engine, FeaturePacks, Templates and Samples.

gpt:
Sorry for the confusion. To start the Unreal Engine Editor on Linux, follow these steps:

Open a terminal: Open a terminal window on your Ubuntu Linux machine.

Navigate to the Engine folder: Use the "cd" command to navigate to the "Engine" folder where you extracted the Unreal Engine files.

Run the "Setup.sh" script: Type the command "./Setup.sh" and press Enter to run the "Setup.sh" script. This script will download and install any additional files that are needed to run the Unreal Engine Editor.

Run the "GenerateProjectFiles.sh" script: Type the command "./GenerateProjectFiles.sh" and press Enter to run the "GenerateProjectFiles.sh" script. This script will generate the project files needed to build and run the Unreal Engine Editor.

Build the editor: Type the command "make" and press Enter to build the Unreal Engine Editor.

Start the editor: Type the command "./Engine/Binaries/Linux/UE4Editor" and press Enter to start the Unreal Engine Editor.

Once the editor is running, you can create a new project or open an existing one and start building your game.




me:
> That's OK. Nobody knows everything yet, not even you. I found the setup script here: ./Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/Setup.sh but it gives me an error. I think I have to download the toolchain too. The webpage said the setup script would download the toolchain but I guess it's wrong.

gpt:
I'm sorry to hear that you encountered an error while running the setup script. You're right that the setup script should download any necessary toolchains, so it's possible that there was a problem with the script or with the download.

Here are some steps you can take to download and install the toolchain manually:

Install dependencies: Make sure you have the required dependencies installed on your Ubuntu Linux machine. You can do this by running the following command in a terminal:
sql
Copy code
sudo apt-get install build-essential mono-devel mono-xbuild mono-dmcs libmono-corlib4.5-cil libmono-system-data-datasetextensions4.0-cil libmono-system-web-extensions4.0-cil libmono-system-management4.0-cil cmake dos2unix clang-10 lib32stdc++6 unzip git
Download the toolchain: Download the toolchain for your version of Linux from the Unreal Engine website. Make sure you download the correct toolchain version that matches the version of the Unreal Engine Editor you downloaded.

Extract the toolchain: Extract the downloaded toolchain to a directory on your Ubuntu Linux machine.

Set environment variables: Set the following environment variables in your terminal session:

bash
Copy code
export UE_ROOT=<path to the Unreal Engine Editor directory>
export PATH=$UE_ROOT/Engine/Extras/ThirdPartyNotUE/SDKs/HostLinux/Linux_x64/<toolchain version>/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$UE_ROOT/Engine/Extras/ThirdPartyNotUE/SDKs/HostLinux/Linux_x64/<toolchain version>/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Replace <path to the Unreal Engine Editor directory> with the path to the directory where you extracted the Unreal Engine Editor files, and <toolchain version> with the version of the toolchain you downloaded.

Run the setup script: Navigate to the Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux directory in the Unreal Engine Editor directory and run the Setup.sh script. This should detect the toolchain you installed and set up the necessary build files.

Build the editor: Navigate back to the Unreal Engine Editor directory and run the following command to build the editor:

Copy code
./Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Build.sh UE4Editor Linux Development
This will compile the Unreal Engine Editor for Linux. Once the compilation is complete, you should be able to start the editor by running UE4Editor from the Engine/Binaries/Linux directory.

I hope this helps you get the Unreal Engine Editor up and running on your Ubuntu Linux machine. Good luck with your game development!




me:
> Thanks, I got it to work. Something weird happened where basic shell programs couldn't find the standard library so I removed the line about LD_LIBRARY_PATH but I think it will work without it. Btw I'm using UE 5, though you may not have been trained on that yet.

gpt:
I'm glad to hear that you were able to get the Unreal Engine Editor up and running on your Ubuntu Linux machine!

You're right that I wasn't trained on Unreal Engine 5 specifically, but the steps I provided should be similar for both UE4 and UE5. If you encounter any further issues or have any questions, feel free to ask. Good luck with your game development!
