Wards - protect against specific effects or broader categories. broader wards are more expensive to cast than specific ones. Magical and physical. can be cast on an area, item or person
examples: teleportation, scrying, invisibility, movement, damage, buffs, debuffs

Wards can be visible or invisible, invisible wards can be detected by spells - broader detection spells are more expensive to cast than specific ones

Powerful spells take a long time to cast and consume a lot of mana
Counterspells and dispels cost about 1/3 of the mana and time of the spell they counter
Quck casting costs more mana. (2x more for 5x speed?) Counterspells will often need to be quick cast.

The maximum strength of a spell a person can cast is limited to the size of their blue mana pool. If the blue mana pool is not full, the remaining mana will come from the yellow pool but the maximum strength remains the same as if the blue mana pool had been full.

Ritual casting removes that limit and slows down casting significantly. The power of a ritual is only limited by how much mana the caster can put into it, which is limited by their blue mana regeneration rate. Powerful rituals require a high regeneration rate.

Wards diminish the effects they protect against by a constant determied by the ward's strength plus a factor determined by the ratio of the wards's strength to the effect's strength.

Spells can be upgraded to have more powerful effects, more effectively pierce wards, be more resistant to dispelling, have greater area of effect, longer duration, longer range, etc.

Targeted dispels and counterspells are cheaper than broad ones. Spells can be identified by spell analysis spells/wards or by observing their effects. A character who has seen a spell cast many times will automatically identify it. If you don't know what a spell is and don't have time to analyze it you can use a broad counterspell or try to guess what effect it produces and use a targeted dispel based on guesswork.


Casters have 3 mana pools:

blue - smallest, regenerates quickly (minutes), is the first to be used. regenerating 1 point of blue costs 0.01 point of yellow.
yellow - about 5x to 10x as big as blue. regenerates slowly (hours). the blue refill rate is reduced proportionally to how much the yellow pool is depleted. this will automatically be used when the blue is empty.
red - about 2x to 3x as big as yellow. regenerates extremely slowly (weeks). requires a separate confirmation from the player before it's used. the user's health and max health are reduced proportionally to how much the red pool is depleted. the yellow and blue pools' max size and regeneration rates are reduced proportionally to how much the red pool is depleted.


casting skill is averaged for each spell effect produced by a spell (weighted avg in case of multiple effects in one spell) and each category the spell belongs to.
casting skill increases positive attributes of a spell and reduce negative ones. damage, speed, mana cost, range.
those attributes can be improved individually in addition to the bonus granted by the casting skill
the size and regeneration rate of each mana pool can also be improved individually with skills

per character: each additional skill point costs exponentially more xp
per skill: higher skill levels produce diminishing return per skill point invested

this allows specialized characters to be more powerful in their speciality than generalists and lets players mix and match freely what skills they want to combine.
