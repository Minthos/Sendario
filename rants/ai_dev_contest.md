Ingame contract system

ai development contract (contest style)

Create a contract to develop an ai for a vehicle, to be rated by its performance in a procedurally generated
trial with objectives and initial conditions specified by the person issuing the contract. The contract can be
open to anyone or a select few.

If it's a contest all submitted solutions are open source so that contestants can copy each other freely. Contestants are rewarded based on how long their solution has held the #1 spot in ELO rank. If a top solution is very similar to another, the author of the first uploaded one gets most of the reward.
