## Characters

Characters have procedurally generated origin stories and inborn traits. Based on this information AI generates
a list of potential events in their future story arc. For example if a character has a conflict with another character,
that conflict can escalate or be resolved. Their beliefs can be challenged and either strengthened or changed. Their injuries, diseases, emotional scars, mental illnesses can become aggravated or healed. They can fall in love and be happy ever after, become dissatisfied, have their heart broken, move somewhere, have kids, make sacrifices, pursue careers, change careers, become successful, fail, and so on.

There should be a huge list of anything that could possibly happen to anyone, and then there should be a system that assigns probability to each event based on the character's history and current circumstances. A combination of AI generated and procedural.


### Phobias

Inborn and acquired

Ask an LLM to generate a list of all phobias that have ever been described in literature, with estimated rarity

On character creation they are randomly assigned a probability of having one or more phobias, and that number of
phobias is then drawn from a loot table of phobias

They are also assigned a probability of having predisposition towards one or more phobias


### Trauma

Each character has an emotional trauma threshold. Stressful life events like getting injured, killing someone, watching
someone die, nearby explosions, natural disasters, hunger, thirst, loneliness, hearbreak, etc etc can cause trauma if the severity of the event exceeds the person's trauma threshold. Characters get a bonus or malus to perceived severity
depending on their psychological and physical well-being. Phobias amplify perceived severity if the event involves the object of the phobia, and predisposition to a phobia can become a phobia if the character is traumatized by the object of their predisposed phobia.


### Quirks and features

Other stuff like personality traits, attributes/abilities, competences, mental and physical illnesses and so on should also be drawn from loot tables similar to the phobias.
