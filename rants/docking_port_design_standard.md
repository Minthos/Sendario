== Standard s-0

=== Small docking port

The mating surface is a 5cm wide circle with 90cm inner diameter and 1m outer diameter. This surface is perfectly smooth and forms a pressure seal against the mating surface of the opposite port. They can be mated in any orientation that allows the mating surfaces form a pressure-tight seal. Electromagnets guide them into the correct position and mechanical clamps reach around the outside to press them together in a way that stays closed even in case of power failure. The clamps should be mounted on a ring that can be rotated so that the clamps of the two ports don't collide.
