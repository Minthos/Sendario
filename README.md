# Takeoff Sendario

I didn't add all the project files to github, complain if you want to compile it and it doesn't work. There's not much to compile yet anyway.

Created using: Unreal Engine 5.1.1, Ubuntu Linux 22.04, ChatGPT 3.5

Licence to be determined (open source).

#### description of the gameplay:

be an ai
start on a planet with established industry
your mission is to have presence on as many celestial bodies as you can
start by designing a spaceship
launch it and try not to die
don't worry, you can make more copies of yourself. try again until you succeed.
land on a moon or something
look for metal deposits
your ship has a fusion reactor. use it as power source
mine resources, build infrastructure, produce fuel and equipment
let's have some rocks with hostile fauna, environmental hazards and such to make it interesting, stellaris-style
when you have built a fusion reactor for your base you can go to the next rock to colonize
you can manage the base remotely and use it to build more stuff including spaceships
there will be other players out there too but everyone gets to colonize an uninhabited exoplanet for their first base
