I didn't add all the project files to github, complain if you want to compile it and it doesn't work. There's not much to compile yet anyway.

Created using: Unreal Engine 5.1.1, Ubuntu Linux 22.04, ChatGPT 3.5

Licence to be determined (open source).

### description of the gameplay:

Be an ai.
Start on a planet with established industry.
Your mission is to have presence on as many celestial bodies as you can.
Start by designing a spaceship.
Launch it and try not to die.
Don't worry, you can make more copies of yourself. Try again until you succeed.
Land on a moon or something.
Look for metal deposits.
Your ship has a fusion reactor. Use it as power source.
Mine resources, build infrastructure, produce fuel and equipment.
Let's have some rocks with hostile fauna, environmental hazards and such to make it interesting, stellaris-style.
When you have built a fusion reactor for your base you can go to the next rock to colonize.
You can manage the base remotely and use it to build more stuff including spaceships.
There will be other players out there too but everyone gets to colonize an uninhabited exoplanet for their first base.

First person gameplay for controlling the spaceship, mining resources and so on.
Remotely controlling bases needs a more strategy game like interface.
Designing hardware should also be a significant part of the game.
PVP combat, trade and politics should be as emergent as possible.
PVE can be designed for singleplayer, small and large groups.
