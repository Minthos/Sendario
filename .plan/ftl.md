to travel activate the warp drive, accelerate to escape trajectory and from there any extra delta-v will increase your warp factor (slowly). warp factor makes your ship's coordinates change at a >1.0 multiple of its velocity. this can mess with gravity assist trajectories. to come out of warp either turn off the warp drive to exit immediately or accelerate backwards to bleed off warp factor gradually. if you turn off the warp drive it will keep the same warp factor so you don't get stranded every time you turn it off, but if you burn in the wrong direction and use up too much dv you can still set sail for fail.
when you travel to a system the server gives you the random seed for that system
the server's universe and galaxy random seeds are secret
if you play singleplayer you can see everything in the game but your universe will not be based on the same random seed as the server's

maximum warp speed should be proportional to ship's delta-v investment in the journey
and the ratio (gaslight drive power rating / log(shipmass))
warp speed for a medium-sized ship at example delta-v

inner solar system: 1 AU/minute @ 10 km/s
interstellar medium: 1 LY/minute @ 1000 km/s

when you exit warp a visual shockwave goes out in a cone-shape in front of you
your ship is at high temperature when you exit warp, making you glow brightly on IR sensors
both from incoming heat from the reality distortion field collapsing and interal heat from the energy used to produce/maintain it
